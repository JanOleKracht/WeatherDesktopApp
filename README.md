# WeatherDesktopApp üå¶Ô∏è

## Description

WeatherApp is a beginner-friendly **C# WPF** application that fetches real-time weather data using the **OpenWeatherMap API**. The project demonstrates how to work with APIs, handle **JSON responses**, use asynchronous programming, and integrate a graphical user interface (GUI) with WPF.

This project is one of my first learning experiences with APIs and C#, primarily created to help me understand backend development and asynchronous programming.

**Note:** The GUI is not yet fully developed, as the primary focus has been on the backend logic for learning purposes.


## Features

- Fetches and displays current weather conditions (temperature, humidity, description, etc.)

- Shows a 5-day weather forecast

- Converts UTC time to local time based on city timezone

- Supports searching for different cities

- Error handling for invalid city names and network issues

- Background image changes dynamically based on the current weather conditions of the selected city


## Technologies Used

- C# (WPF for UI)

- OpenWeatherMap API (for weather data)

- Newtonsoft.Json (for JSON parsing)

- Async/Await (for non-blocking API calls)


## Installation

### Prerequisites

- .NET Framework / .NET Core (depending on your setup)

- Visual Studio (or any C# IDE)


## etup Steps

**1. Clone the repository:**

- git clone https://github.com/JanOleKracht/WeatherDesktopApp.git
  

**2. Set up an OpenWeather API Key:**

- Go to [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) and create a free account.

- Get your API key.

- Insert your API into  ```private string apiKey```
  

**3. Open the project in Visual Studio.**

**4. Run the application by pressing F5.**


## Usage

**1. Enter** a city name in the search bar.

**2.** Press **Enter** or **click** the search button.

## Future Improvements

- Implement MVVM architecture for better separation of concerns

- Add unit tests for API calls and UI

- Improve UI design with better visuals

- Allow users to choose between Celsius and Fahrenheit
